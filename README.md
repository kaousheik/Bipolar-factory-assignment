# Web-Development Assignment

## Problem Statement:

    Develop a webpage that allows the user to load an image and draw as many rectangles on it. The user should be able to delete, redraw and store the state of the image.

## Description

    I developed the website using React and used a package called toast-ui. On opening the application, the user can load an image from his/her local computer and draw shapes like rectangle, circle and triangle on top of the image. The user can also undo, redo and delete a particular rectangle. The toast-ui provides these features and the user can also download the image once he/she has edited it.

### Starting the application

    The application is in development mode. To start the application run the command
    `npm install` (to install all the dependencies),
    Once installed run the command
    `npm start` (to start the application i localhost:3000)
